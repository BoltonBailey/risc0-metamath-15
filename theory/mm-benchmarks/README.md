# Metamath benchmark files

The following is a list of the Metamath benchmark files in the order of their complexity:
1. `wff.mm`: an 8-line proof that a formula is well-defined;
2. `reflexivity.mm`: the proof of `ph -> ph`;
3. `simple.mm`: the proof of `t = t`;
4. `matching-logic-200-loc.mm`: the definition of matching logic in Metamath;
5. `peano.mm`: Peano arithmetics;
6. `sum.mm`: an example proof object generated from K.
